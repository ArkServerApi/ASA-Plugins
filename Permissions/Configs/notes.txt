If you want to use MySQL or MariaDB, set UseMysql to true and fill in the Mysql settings in config.
If you want to use SQLite, set UseMysql to false and optionally set a custom path to the database using DbPathOverride.

Important!! Do not use a DbPathOverride with SQLite if you run more than 1 server, it will not work and cause data access errors or data corruption.

ClusterSyncTime controls how many seconds before it refreshes the player permissions from the database. Minimum is 20 seconds!
